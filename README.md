I'm a technology-agnostic software developer. My interests include but are not limited to software development, mathematics, electronics, physics simulations, computer vision, digital twins, and spatial data.

The projects pinned below are all my own. With the exception of a few included libraries and images they're all written from scratch. For copyright information see the README or LICENCE file in the repository, or the associated project page on [bailey.geek.nz](http://bailey.geek.nz).
